# Airbnb_Analysis

### Problem Statement: Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb has become a service used and recognized by the world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementing innovative additional services, and much more. 

This dataset has around 49,000 observations with 16 attributes, a mix of categorical and numeric values. 
In this project, we explore and analyze the data to discover some essential understandings (not limited to these), such as:
What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
What can we learn from predictions? (e.g., locations, prices, reviews, etc.)
Which hosts are the busiest and why?
Is there any noticeable difference in traffic among different areas, and what could be the reason for it?
